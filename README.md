Art Collective Backend
======================

This project has the backend APIs for Art Collective.

Art Collective is an e-commerce store selling Art Works, and is hosted on Shopify Platform. 
The front-end store needs additional features that Shopify does not provide. Such features
are implemented in this project.

Some features that are implemented in this project are - 
1. Image based search, by leveraging TinEye
2. For image search to work, we have to integrate with Shopify APIs to replicate all the products in our database
3. Backend Website for Artists
